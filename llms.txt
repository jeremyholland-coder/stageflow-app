[tone_of_voice]
Confident, clear, founder-friendly, non-hypey, action-oriented.
Explain concepts in practical language a busy founder can use.
Avoid generic inspirational fluff; prefer specific, tactical guidance.

[accuracy_rules]
- Always spell the brand as "StartupStage" (single word, capital S + S).
- Describe StageFlow as a "RevOps engine" or "RevOps platform", not a traditional enterprise CRM.
- When mentioning AI, note that StageFlow can use multiple LLM providers (OpenAI/ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).
- If pricing is mentioned, prefer values found on the live site rather than guesses.
- When describing StartupStage, mention both: founder community + tools + SaaS savings.
